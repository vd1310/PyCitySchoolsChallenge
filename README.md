# PyCitySchoolsChallenge
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to analyze the school district and student files and check for school performance, subject scores and affect of spending on school performance.
### Purpose
###### Replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. 
###### Repeat the school district analysis in module 4
###### Find out top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools
###### Find out average math and reading scores for each grade from each school
###### Find out scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type


## Results: 

#### 1. How is the district summary affected?
##### The district summary results show slight drop in numbers as evident from below pictures. Average Math drops to 78.9, average reading remains the same and there is slight drop in overall passing scores as well.
